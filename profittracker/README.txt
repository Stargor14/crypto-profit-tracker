Made January of 2021

Using pysimplegui and the json module, I wrote a program that keeps track of my Bitcoin trading profits.
Altough the program is probably very innefficent, I quite proud of it and it was really fun to write.
It also features a profit calculator so that you can pre plan trades or see the % gains you could make off a potential trade.
Using the os module I added a feature to delete all past orders for convenience.
In the lower left area of the gui there is a graph that plots all of your past trades, up to 100. 

I'd like to figure out a way to expand the graph to be longer than 100 orders or higher than 100$, but I am too lazy to do that rn.
